# Open Source Fiscal Sponsor Needs

As an open source project grows, selecting a fiscal sponsor organization that can meet the projects' additional needs is essential. Open source projects and the open source fiscal sponsor space is evolving, as fiscal sponsors shut down, re-orient or start new. Open source funding and support has become even more important to consider thoughtfully as the funding and reuse landscape for open source has changed with the emergence of AI and shifting priorities for technology companies. 

There are two components to 'open source project needs', one is for the projects themselves to determine their [goals](https://github.com/tracykteal/managing-os-project-workshop/blob/main/worksheets/project-goals-users-worksheet.pdf) and the structure that will allow them to best meet those goals. The other are supportive organizations that can help them meet those needs. 
This project outlines what projects need from supportive organizations to reach their goals and ensure sustainability. In this repository, weâ€™ll collect information, outline those needs, and propose categories of projects that may have different sets of needs. 

Initially started by Neil Chue Hong, Carol Willing and Tracy Teal, we started a list of things we've seen that projects need. This can vary significantly depending on the type and stage of the project. So, when you're thinking about what your project needs from a fiscal sponsor, it's also worth thinking about the current state of your project and its goals.
