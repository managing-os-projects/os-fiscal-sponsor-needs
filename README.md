# Open Source Fiscal Sponsor Needs

As an open source project grows, selecting a fiscal sponsor organization that can meet the projects' additional needs is essential. Open source projects and the open source fiscal sponsor space is evolving, as fiscal sponsors shut down, re-orient or start new. Open source funding and support has become even more important to consider thoughtfully as the funding and reuse landscape for open source has changed with the emergence of AI and shifting priorities for technology companies. 

There are two components to 'open source project needs', one is for the projects themselves to determine their goals and the structure that will allow them to best meet those goals. The other are supportive organizations that can help them meet those needs. Why do we need these supportive organizations? 

Primarily it's just inefficient and ineffective to ask each project to navigate essentially learning how to run a business on their own. Some level of organizational management is required for a project to be sustainable, so this is something each project needs to do, at some level. However, open source developers often have a background in software development or research, and they haven't had the training or experience in running a project or organization, and importantly they may also not be interested in spending all their time on organizational matters, rather than writing code. Therefore there's a great opportunity for projects to learn from 'best practices' or have strong sets of recommendations and support, that allow them to learn what they need to learn, but also receive guidance and support for the 'back office' side of the organization that is not something each project needs to create on their own. This helps projects be sustainable, both from a financial perspective, but also from the perspective of providing support and community to open source leaders to reduce burnout. 

However, we haven't yet developed a clear set of guidance for projects around what projects need from a supportive organization. This makes it difficult for projects to identify their needs and look for options, and for organizations like fiscal sponsors to determine what is most important to provide, and what types of projects they would best serve. 

Our goal in this repository is to collect those set of recommendations, to guide both projects and fiscal sponsor organizations. We speak here about fiscal sponsor organizations, because these are currently the most common and the financial component is important to most projects, but some of these support aspects could be provided by other organizations or services. Also, open source projects can form their own organizations, be a part of a company, or choose another path, so there are definitely other options besides fiscal sponsorship, but that's not the focus here. 

In this repository, weâ€™ll collect information, outline those needs, and propose categories of projects that may have different sets of needs. 

Initially started by Neil Chue Hong, Carol Willing and Tracy Teal, we started a list of things we've seen that projects need. This can vary significantly depending on the type and stage of the project. So, when you're thinking about what your project needs from a fiscal sponsor, it's also worth thinking about the current state of your project and its goals. 

It's important this represent the perspective of a wide variety of projects and people, so ideas, discussion and feedback are key. What's not in this list that you think your project needs? What do you think needs more discussion? 

Please create an issue to share ideas, start a discussion or comment on what we've started here. We can go further together.
